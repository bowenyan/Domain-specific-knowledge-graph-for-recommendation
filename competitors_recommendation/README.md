Use patent classes to represent features vectorization. In the experiments, we attempted different classification systems, and suggest to use CPC and WIPO's classification systems.

We also considered the text information of patent documents for vectorization, and which also shows reasonable results. Therefore, we will think about applying text mining techniques to compare technology strength of different agents.
