Problem: The technology space is very dense, the nodes are almost full-connected. It is not easy to visualize this map directly using the existing network visualization techniques. 

In the previous studies, we tried maximum spanning tree and technology expansion power to filter the edges of the technology space, so that we can visualize a map with less edges. This work applies a dimension reduction method to visualize the original technology space maps without removing any strong or weak edges. Later, we could try different dimension reduction methods to see which one is more reasonable. So far, the t-SNE method performs well to visualize these fully-connected networks.
